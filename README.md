# model-catalog-template

This repository contains a templated [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) model catalog, using [Nunjucks templating](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html), compatible with Backstage-based solutions like Red Hat Developer Hub. 

This template is based on the published reference implementation available at https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/model-catalog-example.
